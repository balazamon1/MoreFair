    shootdown:
      title: Sabotage
      intro: Escaping this ladder is not as easy, since you can get shot down by your competition. The reason is needing to wait for 30sec on rank 1.
    grapes:
      title: Grapes
      intro: To shoot someone down or prevent getting shot down, you need grapes. You can get these by either being in last place or getting passed by another Ranker.

      intro: When you have enough vinegar you can throw between 25% - 100% of your current Vinegar.
    wine:
      title: Wine
      intro: Wine is a 1 time shield, that's active when you have more wine than vinegar. The overflow hits the vinegar of the target.
    refunds:
      title: Refunds
      intro: When either wine or vinegar hit 0 you get for each of them 25% of your vinegar from before the throw back (up to 25%, which is the minimum amount of vinegar you need to throw)
  promote:
    top10:
      title: Top10
      intro: Finishing a ladder in the Top 10 also rewards Grapes/Vinegar/AutoPromotes.
